## 🚀 Introducing Snapbyte

We’re excited to announce the launch of **Snapbyte**, a new caching and content delivery platform designed for developers and businesses that need reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient file distribution.

Snapbyte acts as a caching proxy between your origin server and end-users, storing and serving content from a global network of edge locations. This approach reduces origin load, shortens latency, and optimizes bandwidth usage.

> Snapbyte helps developers and businesses **reduce bandwidth**, **accelerate delivery**, and **serve large files globally** — with minimal setup.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🌍 Global Edge Caching**
    Files are cached at edge nodes worldwide, so repeated requests are served closer to the user, reducing round-trip time and improving performance.

* **⚙️ On-Demand Processing**
    Snapbyte can automatically optimize files during delivery — including compression, format conversion (e.g., WebP, AVIF), and resizing for responsive delivery.

* **💰 Usage-Based Pricing**
    Billing is based solely on bandwidth usage. Storage is free for most plans, except for **Enterprise** where permanent storage is available at $7/TB/month.

* **🔌 REST API Access**
    Full API control for:
    * Preloading files into cache
    * Purging cached content
    * Fetching usage statistics
    * Managing signed URLs for secure delivery

* **💪 Proven Performance**
    The system has been serving large-scale workloads (over **1.5 PB of bandwidth** monthly) for more than two years in production under its earlier version.

## 🔧 How Snapbyte Works

```md
[ User / Client ]
       ↓
[ Snapbyte URL Proxy ]
       ↓
[ Snapbyte Edge Cache ]
       ↓
[ Origin Server or Cloud Storage ]
````

1.  Your application generates a public or signed origin URL.
2.  End-users access content via the **Snapbyte proxy URL**.
3.  When a request arrives:
      * If the file exists in edge cache, it’s served immediately.
      * If not, Snapbyte fetches it from the origin, serves it, and stores it for future requests.
4.  API endpoints allow cache management and usage monitoring.



## 📈 Our Experience

Snapbyte has been operating for over 2 years (Under filesos.io), quietly powering a handful of high-demand clients. We've consistently delivered more than **1.5 PB of bandwidth per month**, helping our customers scale without compromise.

This hands-on experience with real-world traffic and performance challenges has shaped Snapbyte into a robust, efficient, and production-ready caching platform — built to handle demanding use cases with ease.

-----

## 💸 Plans Overview

| Plan | Cache Duration | Storage Fees | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trial** | 7 days | Free | Evaluation and testing |
| **Pro** | 30 days (auto-extend on access) | Free | Popular, frequently accessed files |
| **Enterprise** | Permanent | $7/TB/month | Long-term, critical content |

> While Enterprise allows permanent storage, Snapbyte is primarily designed as a caching system, not a long-term storage replacement.

-----

## 🤔 Why Use Snapbyte?

  - Reduce load on your origin servers
  - Serve files faster with global edge nodes
  - Control content access with signed URLs
  - Pay only for the bandwidth you actually use
